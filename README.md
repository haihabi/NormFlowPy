# NormFlowPy
This repository contains the implementation of various types of normalizing flow/ invertible neural networks. In addition, we provide a simple API run, train, and implement new types of normalizing flows.
We have implemented the following layers:
* Affine Coupling
* Invertible 1x1 
* Neural Spline Flow and Cubic Flow
and others. Note, that so implementation's based on other Github repositories and this would be stated in each file.
# Installation
```
pip install normflowpy
```
# Code Examples 
We have provide only a single example at this stage please see [moons notebook](https://github.com/haihabi/NormFlowPy/blob/main/examples/moons_glow_example.ipynb)
# Contribution & Problems

We welcomes contributions from anyone and if you find a bug or have a question, please create a GitHub issue.
