# NormFlowPy
This repository contains the implementation of various types of normalizing flow/ invertible neural networks. In addition, we provide a simple API run, train, and implement new types of normalizing flows.
We have implemented the following layers:

* Affine Coupling
* Invertible 1x1 
* Spline Flow

Note, that so implementation's based on other Github repositories and this would be stated in each file.
